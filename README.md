# FFTWater

*edit: 20/07/2024* just realized my maths were wrong, working on correcting that.

*Important* : this is a work in progress. The simulation currently runs using an unoptimized DFT algorithm that I implemented myself. I still need to code the FFT part of it. The shader is also missing.

# Previous version (no FFT, wrong maths, but it looked quite good)
